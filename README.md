# End-of-Year-Project-for-Computer-Science-Poker-
🎲 An interactive implementation of the game of poker, made with Python 🐍, HTML 📝, CSS 🎨 and Flask 🌶️

This project is a complete implementation of the game of poker, carried out as an end-of-year project for the Computer Science course. The project uses a combination of Python, HTML, CSS, and Flask to create an interactive and visually appealing gaming experience. 🎲
Game Engine: At the heart of 🕹️ the project is a sophisticated game engine written in Python. Not only does it simulate the basic mechanics of poker, but it also handles complex aspects such as deck creation and shuffling, card dealing, hand management, and determining the winner of each hand. But there's much more... 🚀
User Interface 💻: The game's user interface is a masterpiece of design, combining HTML and CSS to create an intuitive and engaging user experience. Not only does it provide a clear layout for players, but it also includes a detailed poker rules table and images of all poker cards. And it doesn't end there... 🌈
Web 🌐 server: The project uses Flask, a microframework for Python, to create a robust and flexible web server. Not only does this server serve the user interface, but it also handles player interactions, allowing for smooth and responsive gameplay. But there's even more... ⚡
Artificial 🧠 Intelligence: One of the most impressive aspects of the project is the artificial intelligence module. This module not only simulates the behavior of the dealer or dealer, but also allows computer-controlled players to make intelligent decisions based on the state of the game. And that's just the beginning... 🤖
